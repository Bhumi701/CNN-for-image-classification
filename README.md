A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most powerful deep learning architectures for image classification.


Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, where the goal is to assign a label to an image based on its visual content. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specifically designed to process and analyze visual data by automatically learning spatial hierarchies of features.  

CNNs use convolutional layers to extract local features such as edges, textures, and shapes, pooling layers to reduce dimensionality while preserving important information, and fully connected layers to perform classification. This architecture allows CNNs to achieve state-of-the-art performance in tasks ranging from handwritten digit recognition to complex object detection.  

In this project, a CNN model has been implemented to classify images into predefined categories. The workflow includes:  
- Preprocessing and normalization of image datasets  
- Designing CNN architecture with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers  
- Training the model using backpropagation and optimization techniques  
- Evaluating performance with metrics such as accuracy and loss
